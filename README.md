Miscellaneous Greasemonkey scripts I use for easing my life

-----------

Greasemonkey is a browser extension that allows you to customize
web pages which are otherwise beyond your control. Like, if you
want to add a dancing unicorn GIF to the header of all pages
in the `.mil` domain, Greasemonkey is your friend. (But you can
only do it on your own browser).

The scripts here make what I think are important usability and
legibility changes to various test log pages.

To install Greasemonkey:
* Firefox: install the [add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/), then follow the directions for installing any of the individual scripts in this repo.
* Chrome: sorry, no idea. There's something called [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) which claims to be equivalent, but I really don't know if it is.
